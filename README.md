# HighPointInArray
find and return the highest value in the array

We are given an array of integer values.
The values are in ascending order but not consecutive 
up to a high value. From then on the values are in
descending order but not consecutive.

If interested in this problem and the approach I used,
I invite you to read the following post in my blog:

Keep in mind that one of the best ways to learn is to
read and experiment. Practice makes perfect.

Enjoy;
